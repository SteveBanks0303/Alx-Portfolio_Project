The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. The game is represented visually with a gallows and a series of empty spaces representing each letter in the word.

To build the Hangman game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you would start by creating the basic structure of the game using HTML. This would include a container for the gallows, a section to display the word with blank spaces, an input field for the player to enter their guesses, and a button to submit the guess.

Using CSS, you can style the elements to give the game a visually appealing look. You can design the gallows using CSS to resemble the traditional hangman structure. You can also style the word display section with appropriate fonts and colors.

Next, you would use JavaScript to add interactivity to the game. You would define an array of words that will be used as the hidden words in the game. You can randomly select a word from the array each time the game starts.

When the player submits a guess, you would capture the input using JavaScript. You would then compare the guessed letter with the letters in the hidden word to determine if it's a correct guess or not. If it's correct, you would update the word display section to reveal the correctly guessed letters. If it's incorrect, you would update the gallows by adding a new element representing a body part of the hangman.


You can add additional features to enhance the game, such as keeping track of the letters the player has already guessed, displaying a message when the game ends (win or lose), and providing a button to start a new game.

Overall, the Hangman game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provides an interactive and enjoyable experience for players as they try to guess the hidden word while avoiding the hangman's fate.
